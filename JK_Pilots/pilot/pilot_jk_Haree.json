        "Details": "Originally a ground-pounder NCO in the 2nd Robinson Rangers, Haree left the Federated Suns Military to join the Steel Jaguars mercenary unit.  Despite having very little BattleMech experience, he quickly adapted to the life of a MechWarrior, with his natural combat and leadership abilities helping to propel him through the ranks.  It seemed like Haree had barely moved into his locker before he was granted command of the entire division, expedited somewhat by his predecessor taking an AC/10 round through the cockpit.\r\n\r\nUnder Haree's guidance, the Steel Jaguar Battalion became the unit to hire if you absolutely had to get the job done.  During his tenure as Commander, the unit had only failed a contract once, just prior to Haree retiring his mantle.  Despite appearances to the contrary, it wasn't this failure that made him stand down though.  Rather, it was the draw of his life long dream to take the money he had earned and settle down on his home world of Robinson.  Haree yearned to feel the grass between his toes instead of the burn of melting BattleMech armor in his nostrils.\r\n\r\nRecently Haree has seen his savings become just another casualty of the Succession Wars and has been drawn into trying to find an employer, with one eye on the dream he still holds on to.",
