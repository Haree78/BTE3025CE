        "Details": "Haree joined the Steel Jaguar merc unit wet behind the ears, his experience mostly in the Infantry, but his ability to pick up combat in a Battlemech so quickly helped him become the Commanding Officer of his division before he had barely moved in to his locker, expedited somewhat by his predecessor taking an AC10 through the cockpit.  Haree's Steel Jaguar division was the unit to hire if you absolutely had to get the job done, never failing a contract once until just before retiring his mantle as the Commander. It wasn't this failure that made him stand down though, despite appearances.  It was the draw of his life long dream to take his money earned and settle down on his home planet again, to feel the grass between his toes, and not feel the burn of melting Battlemech armor in his nostrils.  Recently Haree has seen his savings be just another casualty of the Succession Wars and has been drawn in to trying to find an employer, with one eye on his dream he still holds on to.",
