        "Details": "Minor border flare-ups are still occurring, including a recent attack on the [[DM.Factions[faction_Steiner],Lyran]] world [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Zaniah],Zaniah]] by [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarikFWLM],Free Worlds League forces]].  The enigmatic [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMercSnordsIrregulars],Snord's Irregulars]] were sent to relieve the beleaguered Lyran forces on Zaniah driving off the invading forces.  Civilian casualties over the course of the raid were high as the [[DM.Factions[faction_Marik],Free Worlds League]] forces primary raid targets were all in major population centers.  ComStar extends their prayers to those impacted by the senseless violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCorpSLLewisInc],S.L. Lewis Inc.]] has begun shipping their first production run of [[DM.VehicleDefs[vehicledef_SAVANNAHMASTER].Description,Savannah Master]] hover scout vehicles, with the Lyran Commonwealth being the primary investor.   These small craft barely qualify as a combat vehicle with very little armor and only a single Medium Laser, though they do move at an impressive speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPirate raids continue while the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreGreatHouses],Great Houses]] are preoccupied with their own goals.",
