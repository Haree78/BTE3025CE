        "Details": "The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAllianceGames],2nd Alliance Games]] were held on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_TauCeti(NewEarth2116+)],New Earth]] throughout August.  Broadcast to both the [[DM.Factions[faction_Steiner],Lyran Commonwealth]] and [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]], the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreSteinerLCAF],LCAF]] once again had a tough time of it, losing all mock engagements against their [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDavionAFFS],AFFS]] counterparts.  We are sure many viewers in Lyran space were disappointed in their showing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDistracting from the games, the assault on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Galtor],Galtor III]] continues with the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Combine]] looking like they will be the clear winner in the engagement, with only a few minor obstacles standing in their way before conquering the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRebellious elements resorted to violence on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Hongqiao],Hongqiao]] after the announcement of new tax laws from Regulus.  In what has been seen as a heavy handed reaction, 'Mech units (including the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLMRollingThunder],Rolling Thunder]]) were dispatched to deal with the guerilla elements on the steamy jungle world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA missile heavy variant of the [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_hunchback_HBK-4G],Hunchback]] has made its appearance, the new [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_hunchback_HBK-4SP],HBK-4SP]] relies on its twin [[DM.WeaponDefs[Weapon_SRM_SRM6_0-STOCK],SRM-6s]] to dish out a hellish spread of damage.  Though less concentrated than the standard Hunchback's payload, 4 tons of [[DM.AmmoDefs[Ammunition_SRM].Description,SRM ammo]] keep the missiles flying.",
