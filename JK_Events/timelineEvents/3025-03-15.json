The revolts took a violent turn in the past month and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMarikFWLM],FWLM]] forces, including elements of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLMRegulanHussars],Regulan Hussars]] were brought in to subdue the locals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMostly quite in recent years, there has been some activity throughout the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRimwardPeriphery],Rimward Periphery]] with saber rattling amongst some of the minor powers.  There has also been an increase in pirate attacks on outlying systems in that region.",
