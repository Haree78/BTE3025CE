Even the vaunted [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDCMSSorensonsSabres],Sorenson's Sabers]] couldn't pull a victory from the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt looks like the independence movement on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Norn(Verthandi)],Verthandi]] has taken a critical blow, with their leaders killed during a poorly planed assault on the capital city of Regis.  However, [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] troops continue to face minor armed resistance - apparently from some organized militia units backed by mercenaries.",

We also look back at the effort of ComStar in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LorePeriphery],Periphery]], with multiple [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHPG],HPG stations]] being built to help bridge the communication gap between the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]] and the Periphery, and new water filtration systems bringing clean and pure water to those in need.
