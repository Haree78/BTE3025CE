        "Details": "Acting on claims that date back over seven centuries, the [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Capellan Confederation]] invaded the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]] world of [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Redfield],Redfield]] and is currently occupying it.  Elements of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCCAFStIvesLancers],1st St Ives Lancers]] and [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMercBigMAC],McCarron's Armored Cavalry]] were among the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreLiaoCCAF],CCAF]] units involved in the invasion.  The [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDavionAFFS],AFFS]] has been slow to respond to this incursion.  Reports of a new Capellan BattleMech seen in the engagement appear to be nothing more than some sort of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFrankenMech],FrankenMech]] amalgamation they are calling the [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_cataphract_CTF-1X],Cataphract]] rather than a truly new design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have also been reports of a new [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_urbanmech_UM-R60X],UrbanMech]] refit in the service of [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseLiao],House Liao]], which adds further anti-personnel capabilities with a machine gun by downgrading the sanctioned number of heat sinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the [[DM.Factions[faction_Steiner],Lyran Commonwealth]] continues to gear up for war with [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCorpCyclopsInc],Cyclops Inc.'s]] new Hover Tank, the [[DM.VehicleDefs[vehicledef_DRILLSON].Description,Drillson]].  With its primary armaments of a [[DM.WeaponDefs[Weapon_Laser_LargeLaser_0-STOCK],Large Laser]] and [[DM.WeaponDefs[Weapon_LRM_LRM10_0-STOCK],LRM-10]] can cause a considerable amount of damage at range.",
