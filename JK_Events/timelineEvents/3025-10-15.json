        "Details": "An upwelling of civic pride, and displeasure with the occupying [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]] troops has turned into an independence movement on the world of [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Norn(Verthandi)],Verthandi]].  Sadly this has resulted in outbreaks of violence across the world and the Combine is expected to come down heavy on these seditionists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe situation on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Galtor],Galtor III]] has taken an unexpected turn, it appears that [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHanseDavion],The Fox]] finally turned his attention to the campaign and dispatched the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAFFSCrucisLancers],4th Crucis Lancers]] to reinforce the beleaguered [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDavionAFFS],AFFS]] units.  The Lancers were able to turn the tide and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] has been driven from the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA radical new Combine variant, the [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_trebuchet_TBT-7K],Trebuchet TBT-7K]] aims to use direct-fire support instead of the more typical indirect-fire model.  Only time will tell if this is truly a viable alternative to the tried and true standard [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_trebuchet_TBT-5N],Trebuchet]].",
