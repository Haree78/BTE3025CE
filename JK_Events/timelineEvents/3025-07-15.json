Once again, the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreDavionAFFS],AFFS]] appear to have been caught flat footed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems the [[DM.Factions[faction_Davion],Federated Suns]] can't catch a break, the [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]] launched a massive assault on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Galtor],Galtor III]] last month, with a combined effort by several [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKuritaDCMS],DCMS]] units.  From all reports, it sounds like the local AFFS troops are outmatched and outnumbered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unusual report has come in about a radical [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_charger_CGR-1A1],Charger]] variant which was developed by a master technician in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMercHRB],Hat-in-the-Ring]] mercenary unit.  The so-called '[[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_charger_CGR-SB],Challenger]]' reduces the engine to upgrade the weapon payload to be a serious threat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Combine has unveiled a new Tokugawa variant, the [[DM.VehicleDefs[vehicledef_TOKUGAWA_TKG-151].Description,TKG-151]], which is armed with dual [[DM.WeaponDefs[Weapon_Autocannon_AC2_0-STOCK],Autocannon 2s]] for ranged sniping.",
