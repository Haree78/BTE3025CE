If not for the actions of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreFWLMRollingThunder],Rolling Thunder Company]], it is likely the unit would have met their end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCorpRedDevilInd],Red Devil Industries]], located on [[DM.SystemDefs[starsystemdef_Pandora],Pandora]] in the [[DM.Factions[faction_Steiner],Lyran Commonwealth]], have unveiled a new variant of the venerable [[DM.MechDefs[mechdef_battlemaster_BLR-1S],BattleMaster]] design, this new variant focuses more on acting in a missile support role.  This will surely pose a new threat to both their neighbors - truly Pandora's Box has been opened once again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been continued reports of increased pirate activity along the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreCorewardPeriphery],Coreward Periphery]] borders of the Lyran Commonwealth and [[DM.Factions[faction_Kurita],Draconis Combine]].",
