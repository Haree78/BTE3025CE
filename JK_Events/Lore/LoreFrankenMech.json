    "Details" : "FrankenMech is a slang term for 'Mechs that are put together piecemeal, combining parts from different 'Mech designs, typically with no particular bias to any one parent design.  They may be something as 'simple' as the top and bottom of two different 'Mechs of similar classes or 'Mechs that have been cobbled together over centuries that no longer resemble any standard model or variant.",
