In an attempt to be as fair as possible, and keep the odds as even as possible, opponents are matched by comparative weight classes and weapon load-outs with the Tournament Committees determining the best arenas for each fight.  The winner walks away with upwards of \u00A2500,000 purse and often attracts merchandising deals.",
