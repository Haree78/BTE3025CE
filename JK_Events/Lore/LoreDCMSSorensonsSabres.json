    "Name" : "Sorenson's Sabers",
    "Details" : "Part of the 5th Sword of Light, Sorenson's Sabers is something of an anomaly in the DCMS.  While listed as a 'Mech company, this elite unit also has an Aerospace Fighter and LAM assigned as part of their unit - in the Combine's typically rigid military structure, this is uncommon to say the least.  The Sabers excel at the 5th's doctrine of hitting hard and fast, with their Aerospace assets allowing them even more flexibility in their engagements.",
