    "Name" : "ComStar News Bureau",
    "Details" : "Formed in 2826, the ComStar News Bureau was formed as an independent and unbiased agency that would provide news throughout the Inner Sphere and beyond via their HPG network.  Whilst the public at large feels this is largely the case, their competitors point out that they peddle a fair amount of \"fake news\", propaganda and inflammatory information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Draconis Combine and Capellan Confederation both attempted to censor or block broadcasts from CNB, but were threatened by ComStar that any interference would be seen as a violation of the Communications Protocol of 2787, and their realms would be subject to interdiction.  Needless to say, both nations backed down quickly.",
