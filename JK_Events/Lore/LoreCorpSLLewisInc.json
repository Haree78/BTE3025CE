    "Details" : "Founded in 3017, the S.L. Lewis Inc. was formed after a spectacular Star League supply cache discovery by the Merchant-class JumpShip Winnetka.  As his share of the items recovered, Warrant Officer Lewis claimed more than 2,000 Omni 25 Fusion Engines.  But instead of making a quick profit in just selling the rare engines, Lewis held onto the engines and developed a new light hover scout vehicle in 3025, the Savannah Master, which he is hoping to sell to the LCAF in bulk.",
