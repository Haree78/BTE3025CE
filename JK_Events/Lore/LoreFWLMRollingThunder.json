    "Details" : "Formed from the remnants of three companies of the 1st Regulan Hussars that had been savaged during the Marik Civil War.  This new company gained something of a reputation as a non-holds barred unit that was formed for assault missions.  Originally called Ripper's Reavers, in 3016 during joint raid on Dixie with Wolf's Dragoons, the Dragoons were nearly cut off until the Reavers charged into the enemy forces like (in the words of Jaime Wolfe himself) \"Rolling Thunder\".  Thanks to their fearless and frenzied assault, the raid was a success.",
