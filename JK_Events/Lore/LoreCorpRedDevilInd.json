    "Details" : "Having a somewhat shady reputation as operating just this side of the law, Red Devil Industries started out as a tech school and private maintenance company on the Lyran Commonwealth world of Pandora.  They later diversified into weapon systems manufacturing and finally begun BattleMech production in the late 2900s.  The company is somewhat struggling, but is hoping some upcoming Lyran military contracts will finally see them in the black.",
