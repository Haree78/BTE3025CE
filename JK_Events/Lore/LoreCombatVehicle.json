    "Details" : "Typically used in smaller scale conflicts, garrison/militia duty or in support of BattleMechs, Combat Vehicles are used by all the various factions of the Inner Sphere and Periphery as a way to spare their more valuable 'Mechs.  Much like 'Mechs, they are typically categorized by weight classes, but also further defined by motive type.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the more common wheeled and tracked vehicles, the hover craft is also still quite a common sight.  There are also Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) and Naval (both surface and submariner) vehicles, though these are rarely seen out of specialty combat zones.",
