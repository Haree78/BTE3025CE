    "Name" : "Aerospace Fighters",
    "Details" : "In many ways very similar to Conventional Fighters, Aerospace Fighters are capable of operating in both atmosphere and space.\r\n\r\nWhile more durable then their conventional counterparts, and a potent player on the battlefield, they utilize advanced technologies that are much harder to produce, even compared to BattleMechs.  This combined with the excessive costs of building and maintaining them has prevented Aerospace Fighters from gaining a dominant role on the battlefield.",
