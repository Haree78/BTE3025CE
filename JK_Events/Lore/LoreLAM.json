    "Details" : "Created during the Star League era, the Land-Air 'Mech (or LAM) is a hybrid design which is capable of shifting between BattleMech and Aerospace Fighter modes, including an AirMech mode that combines elements of both.  While this makes for a very flexible unit, which is able to fulfill multiple mission parameters, it is at the cost of power and protection.\r\n\r\nLAMs excel in a reconnaissance role.  But their fragility and rarity (even in the Star League era) have made them a very rare sight indeed.",
